A new way controlling your Fans under Linux ...


**The Problems**

The most common way to control a fan is to get a related temperature and to calculate a fan speed.
Example : 35 C° -> 35 * 100 = 3500 rpm . Then we raise or lower the pwm Value until we've got 3500 rpm.
This approach is very simple but also stupid. Because we didn't know if this fanspeed is too high and you are annoyed by the noise of your fan or the fanspeed is so low that your temperature still raise ...

A often seen Problem under Linux is that the Fanspeed is missing if you want to control the fanspeed by yourself. It seems a good way for Hardware manufactures to avoid People from controlling fans...
